# Child Protection

Student Robotics, by its very nature, involves interaction with minors \(individuals under the age of 18\). The Trustees are in the process of consulting on drawing up a suitable child protection policy, however in the meantime the following policy is in effect:

All minors that a Student Robotics volunteer is working with must be supervised at all times by a responsible adult who is DBS checked \(e.g. a teacher\). Volunteers must never meet with minors who are competing in the Competition Program outside of an environment where the above requirement is not satisfied. If you have any concerns regarding child protection or interactions with minors please contact the trustees: [trustees@studentrobotics.org](mailto:trustees@studentrobotics.org).
